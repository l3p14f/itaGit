        <p><strong>Stojanović Mokranjac</strong><a href="#">(January 9, 1856–1914)</a> was a Serbian composer and music educator. Work was essential in bringing the spirit of <br>
        Valach Serbian unwritten folk poems into organized art. 
        <br>    
        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>He was born in <a href="#">Negotin</a>. From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second last name <strong>Mokranjac</strong>(literally: resident of <a href="#">Mokranje</a>). <br> 
        He graduated from the <strong>Belgrade high school</strong>, and attended the natural science and mathematics section of the <strong>University of Belgrade</strong>. <br>
        In 1879 he traveled to <a href="#">Munich</a> where he studied music in the class of <a href="#">Josef Rheinberger</a>. After a brief break, he continued to study in <a href="#">Rome</a> <br>
        in the class of <a href="#">Parisotti</a>, in 1884. Returning to <strong>Serbia</strong> in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the <a href="#">Kornelije Stanković</a> choir of <strong>Belgrade</strong>. <br>
        From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in <a href="#">Leipzig</a>, <strong>Germany</strong>. Upon his return to <strong>Serbia</strong> in 1887 he became the conductor of the Belgrade <br> 
        singing society (Belgrade Choir). From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the <strong>Belgrade high school</strong>, and in 1901 transferred to <strong>Bogoslovija</strong> <br>
        (Belgrade Theological College) where he taught church singing. Together with <a href="#">Stanislav Binički</a> and <a href="#">Cvetko Manojlović</a>, <strong>Mokranjac</strong> <br>
        founded the first independent music school in 1899 - <strong>Serbian Music School</strong> in <strong>Belgrade</strong>. He remains the director of this school until <br> 
        his death. Today the school bares his name. His work as a melograph bore many transcriptions of thus far unwritten folk songs.<br>
        Stevan Mokranjac <strong>died</strong> in <a href="#">Skopje</a>, <strong>Macedonia</strong> (then Kingdom of Serbia), aged 58. Every year, the town of <strong>Negotin</strong> organizes a music <br>
        festival in his honor called <a href="#">Mokranjčevi dani</a> (Days of Mokranjac). The town also has a <a href="#">Mokranjac museum</a>.

        <h3>Works</h3>
    
        <p> His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used these two types of music as inspiration for his work. His most famous <br>
            pieces are the <strong>fifteen Rukoveti</strong> (Potpourri; literally: "handfuls" or "bunches") - a collection of songs and music (orchestral suites) based on<br>
            motives of <strong>Serbian</strong> folk music from <strong>Bosnia and Herzegovina</strong>, <strong>Serbia Proper</strong>, <strong>Montenegro</strong>, <strong>Kosovo and Metohija</strong>, <strong>Macedonia</strong> and <strong>Bulgaria</strong>. 
            His other prominent folk-based works include <a href="#">Primorski napjevi</a> (Coastland tunes), and <a href="#">Kozar</a>. A significant number of his works <br>
            were made for church services. Such as the <a href="#">Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog</a> (The Divine Liturgy of St. Chrysostom), from <br>
            which the <a href="#">Heruvimska pesma</a> (Cherubic hymn) is most famous. Another two famous religious pieces are Tebe Boga hvalim (Te Deum) and <br>
            <a href="#">Veličanije Sv. Savi (Megalynarion to St. Sava)</a>.
