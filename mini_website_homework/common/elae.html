        <h3>Early life and education</h3>
        <p>Early life

            Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October<br>
            (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of Idvor (in the<br>
            modern-day municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat,<br>
            in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire. He always<br>
            remembered the words of his mother and cited her in his<br>
            autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor (1925):<br>
            <br>
            “My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which<br>
            you hear so much at the neighborhood gatherings, you must provide yourself with another pair of eyes, the eyes of<br>
            reading and writing. There is so much wonderful knowledge<br>
            and learning in the world which you cannot get unless you<br>
            can read and write. Knowledge is the golden ladder over<br>
            which we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which<br>
            illuminates our path through this life and leads to a future life<br>
            of everlasting glory.”<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to German 
            elementary school in Perlez. He enrolled in high<br>
            school in Pančevo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of the best students there, a 
            local archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent,<br>
            and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.
            Because of his activity in the “Serbian Youth” movement, which at that time had many<br>
            problems with Austro-Hungarian police authorities, Pupin had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, 
            where he continued the sixth and first<br>
            half of the seventh year. After his father died in March 1874, the sixteen-year-old Pupin decided to cancel his education in Prague due to financial<br>
            problems and to move to the United States.
            <br>
            <br>
            “When I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. Had I brought five hundred dollars, instead of five cents,<br>
            my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would have been the same. A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin<br>
            his career until he has spent all the money which he has brought with him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of prune pie,<br>
            which turned out to be a bogus prune pie. It contained nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, it would have taken me a little<br>
            longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus things, but the struggle which awaited me would have been the same in each case. It is no handicap to a boy<br>
            immigrant to land here penniless; it is not a handicap to any boy to be penniless when he strikes out for an independent career, provided that he has<br>
            the stamina to stand the hardships that may be in store for him.”

        <h3>Studies in America and Ph.D</h3>
        <p>    
            For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual laborer (most notably at the biscuit factory on Cortlandt Street in Manhattan)<br>
            while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private lectures. After three years of various courses, in the autumn of 1879 he successfully<br>
            finished his tests and entered Columbia College, where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin's predicted that his<br>
            physique would make him a splendid oarsman, and that Columbia would do anything for a good oarsman. A popular student, he was elected president<br>
            of his class in his Junior year. He graduated with honors in 1883 and became an American citizen at the same time. He obtained his Ph.D. at the<br>
            University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1889 he returned to Columbia University to become a lecturer of mathematical physics in<br>
            the newly formed Department of Electrical Engineering. Pupin's research pioneered carrier wave detection and current analysis. Pupin completed his<br>
            studies in 1883 as one of the best students, especially in the field of physics and mathematics, which gave him a diploma. Later, he went back to<br>
            Europe, initially the United Kingdom (1883–1885), where he continued his schooling at the University of Cambridge. He was an early investigator<br>
            into X-ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the United States is incorrect. He learned of Röntgen's discovery of unknown<br>
            rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, and thin metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum<br>
            tube, which he had previously used to study the passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images on January 2, 1896.<br>
            Edison provided Pupin with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty<br>
            times, from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated secondary<br>
            X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first person to use a fluorescent<br>
            screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X-ray image of his left hand prior to<br>
            an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging failed because the patient, a well-known lawyer, was "too weak<br>
            and nervous to be stood still nearly an hour" which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo at the time. In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent<br>
            screen was placed on a photographic plate and the patient's hand on the screen. X-rays passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to<br>
            fluoresce, which then exposed the photographic plate. A fairly good image was obtained with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot<br>
            as if "drawn with pen and ink." Dr. Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.
